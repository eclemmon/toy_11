# Setup

## Opening the *toy_11* Interface

Unscrew the four M3 hex bolts affixing the top of the interface to the rest of the body.

## Inserting Batteries Into the *toy_11* Interface

**Important: Observe correct polarity. Inserting batteries backward may permanently damage the shield.**

1) Locate the + (positive) and – (negative) markings on the battery holder.

2) Insert an 18650 Li-ion battery into the slot:

    * Positive (+) end → matches the + marking
    * Negative (–) end → against the - marking

3) Press the batteries gently into the spring and seat it fully.

4) Confirm batteries are secure and properly aligned before powering the shield.
